# main strategy for game handling:

# 1. check for user input - player can examine an entity or interact with it
# when the player does, check the entity's associated properties to see what should be done
# 2. check the map node's associated story elements
# go to most recent story element, display as needed
# 3. player may initiate combat with an entity
# if so, go to combat mode

# when you first enter a node, check to see if there's hostile NPCs present
# if there are, set combat_mode=1
# while in combat mode, check to see if the timer flag is set, and what the time
# every loop, check the time and make sure you're under it.
# check for player input, and when you detect player input, start figuring out NPC combat actions
# apply actions, re-loop

# if there's not hostile NPCs, then enter map mode
# when you enter map mode, check the current map node, and look at its stories
# find the youngest unlocked story element, display it (unless it has a display_once flag set)
# if there are none, default to the basic node description
