[Node_Name:Endless Desert]
[Descriptive_Text:The road goes on for miles, and as you walk, the suns begin to set, your shadows lengthening into long streaks. Some of the half-buried remnants of ships begin to glow, wires hanging from their carcasses giving off an eerie turquoise light. You occasionally catch a glimpse of movement deep in the flickering shadows of the wrecks, but they do not come nearer.]
