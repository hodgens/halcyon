# one thing I'd really like to be able to do is make it easy to insert new map elements (referred to from here on as nodes)
# this is an example of something I'd like to work up, and liable to change, but should help structure the writing
# at game creation, this file will be read in by the game and used to populate the map

# first, each node is delimited by curley brackets: {}
# elements within each node are delimited by square brackets: []
# Immediately after the opening square bracket is the name of the field
# after that, is any flavor text you want to include.
# the game will strip out newline characters when parsing this, so make it readable however works best for you

# I'll set up a distinction here between newlines and pages
# A page will be when you want to wipe everything off the screen and start fresh
# A newline will be when you want to make a new paragraph within the page.
# Newlines will be denoted by ==== - when the game sees that string of characters, it will typeset a new line
# Page Breaks will be denoted by **** - when the game sees that, it will wipe the screen blank and start typesetting fresh

# Player descriptions will be denoted by @@, such as:
# "The mosnter strikes your skull, staining your @hairColour@ hair with your blood.

# Each node will have a "story" to it - it's the way of setting story event flags
# Stories will not be stored in the Node itself, but stored as their own units in another file.
# This lets me use the same markup I've used here, but without the crazy stupid markup
# Just a simple one-room non-story node would have an implicit story of "it exists"
# Stories are made up of three necessary elements: the prerequisite, the content, and the effect
# Story element design is going to be complicated, so see the template for a better walkthrough
# The story element effect section is pretty much the only place where you're going to have to approach real code, but I'll try to keep it simple
# If you name a node flag, it'll turn that flag to 1, or on. (or maybe flip it, dunno)
# You can also change an NPC trait - this will be done by calling the appropriate method related to the NPC's object, so it will be something like NPC.levelup() or NPC.setcondition(poisoned=1)

# NPCs will all have a "home" node - it's where their story flags are kept.
# The game will use the supplied NPC name as 
# In order to keep things not-cluttered here, just give hte NPC name, and the NPC data will be supplied in a separate (similar) file
